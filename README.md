## Inspiration
In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, businesses and people around the world are facing a new reality. Ever since the outbreak of the pandemic, the internet has been instrumental in keeping the world up and running. Social media especially has become the fuel that has helped businesses and brands thrive. There is currently no simple, intuitive way to organize and see all your comments and messages on Instagram. This means many business owners are missing important comments and messages without even knowing them. Some of my friends running small scale businesses have missed some orders and important messages due to flooded Instagram DMs with unimportant messages.

## What it does
Smart Social solves this and helps you find, organize, and respond to your Instagram post and ad comments quickly and easily.
After connecting your Instagram account to our mobile app which is available for both iOs and android or through Desktop Application available for Windows, Linux and macOS and you’ll start receiving all your messages and notifications from Instagram – all in one place and that too organised into different categories making it easier to respond and get insights.
Keeping track of the comments and messages of every single post of yours can be an extremely tedious and time taking task. Not to mention if you have thousands of followers. Scrolling through every single comment often takes hours and the chances of missing out on some of the important messages are very high. Our app puts forward a solution to this.
 There can be messages enquiring about the prices of the items that are for sale, those seeking collaborations, tips for improving the presentation of your content, requests for posting certain content, favourable feedbacks, nasty comments and even just smileys. Connecting your social media account to our app can help get all of these well organized, relieving you from the laborious task of going through every single comment and message. 

## How we built it
To arrange the comments in different kinds, we use a supervised text classification along with clustering techniques. The text is supervised when the classification categories are specified. It is based on the idea of training and testing. We supply labelled data to the learning algorithm. The algorithm is trained on the data set and the required result is delivered. During the testing stage, unseen data are given to the algorithm and classified according to the training phase into categories. At the same time, various types of unseen comments are classified using the unsupervised clustering technique.

## Challenges we ran into
Since this is a multiclass classification problem, when compared to the normal sentiment analysis( which classifies the data into either positive or negative ) or spam classifier( which classifies the email into the spam or non-spam), the challenge of making accurate classifications for each of the specific categories was a challenge that we came across. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're delighted to develop something that could benefit numerous influencers in social media and those doing business via social media. Each of us may have experienced some terrible experiences of not receiving a response to an enquiry or a comment. This may have resulted in you not making a purchase or having a negative perception of the individual. This app can bring down such problems and also put an end to it in its second phase, by being able to send automatic replies for the appropriate message.

## What we learned
We have learned about various clustering and classification techniques. We have also understood the relevance of having enough data in machine learning problems. We have also studied in-depth the many problems facing influencers and business people in social media.

## What's next for SMART SOCIAL
We aim to incorporate an automatic reply mechanism for the structured messages and comments in the second phase of SMART SOCIAL. Automatically responding with a ‘Thankyou’ or a smiley, for thousands of messages wishing you or congratulating you, all at once, can save you a lot of time. Also, formatting a reply just once for numerous enquiries about your product, will make sure that the customer gets the information that he/she wants and helps to maintain your business.
We will be extending our app to include other social media platforms. We will be also adding a self-learning model that could categorize messages based on the few inputs that you give.
